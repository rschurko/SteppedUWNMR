# Field-Stepped Ultra-Wideline NMR

MATLAB GUI for fitting ultra-wideline quadrupolar NMR patterns using field-stepped acquisitions

## Requirements
- All testing has been done on MATLAB 2020a and newer
- The Parrallel Computing Toolbox in MATLAB

## Installation
- MATLAB needs to be installed
- Download the .mlappinstall file and follow the installation instructions

## Features
- Simulate central transition NMR patterns of half-integer quadrupolar nuclei acquired with incremented field strength
- Can simulate any number of evenly-spaced field increments; the simulated increments are attenuated by a window function 
- Two site simulations
- Can overlay an experimental spectrum if it is pre-processed as a .mat file 
- spec.mat is a pre-processed spectrum that is included as an example (use a 20 MHz spectral window and 0 Hz offset)
